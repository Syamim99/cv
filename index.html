                Education is my passion, wether it supporting people by personally teaching or by providing a platform to facilitate
                other to learn and teach. I believe Education is the most important aspect of our life that will decide how our civilization
                will endure, survive, thrive and ascend, or collapse, destroyed, reduce to ash, and no trace in history. I think before we step
                into other aspect in our life, at first we need to upscale our education quality, both in micro and macro scale. If its done,
                then the other aspect will follow.
              </p>
              <p align="justify">Thats why I invested my time, collaborating with my partners, creating and managing a team to build a platform to facilitate others, an Academic System and also
                an E-learning Platform, under the flag of Truesight Teknologi Indonesia, a small company we created based on Surabaya & Sidoarjo, East-Java, Indonesia.
                it is indeed small, but every long journey start with one small step isn't it ?

                We don't build this company or system to rake money, I mean, with the current trends of startup company with a huge pool of capital,
                who am I to compete with them ? no, I just want to do my part. I've been defeated many times before, my ego is broken, I dont care about spotlight
                anymore, I just want to be useful.
